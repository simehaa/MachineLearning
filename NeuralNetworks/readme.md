# The Comparisons of Neural Network and Regression Techniques

## Dependencies:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Tensorflow
* Imblearn
* Seaborn

## How to run
Modify which analyses to run in main.py. Further modifications must be done in functions.py which contains most of the specific analysis code. The backend algorithms are written quite generally as classes in linear\_regression.py, logistic\_regression.py and neural\_networks.py. To run the code, simply run 
```
$ python main.py
```
Although, as of this date (Nov. 2019), there are a few FutureWarnings that are automatically printed by numpy. These can be ignored by running
```
$ python -W ignore main.py
```
