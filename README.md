# Machine Learning Repository
At the time of writing, this repository contains various projects and course material on machine learning (ML). Currently, this repository has been used for fys-stk4155 (applied data analysis and machine learning) and stk-in4300 (statistical learning methods in data science).

In the future, I plan to put course material from other courses, such as in5400 (machine learning for image analysis) and possibly my own machine learning projects.
